Diffusion of Innovations, 5th Edition by Everett M. Rogers

Information about an innovation is often sought from peers, especially information about their subjective evaluations of the innovation. This information exchange about a new idea occurs through a convergence process involving interpersonal networks. The diffusion of innovations is essentially a social process in which subjectively perceived information about a new idea is communicated from person to person. The meaning of an innovation is thus gradually worked out through a process of social construction.Read more at location 671   

There is nothing more difficult to plan, more doubtful of success, nor more dangerous to manage than the creation of a new order of things…. Whenever his enemies have the ability to attack the innovator, they do so with the passion of partisans, while the others defend him sluggishly, so that the innovator and his party alike are vulnerable. Niccolò Machiavelli, The Prince (1513)Read more at location 691   
 
Only individuals who are not integrated into local networks risk defying the community norm on water boiling. An important factor regarding the adoption rate of an innovation is its compatibility with the values, beliefs, and past experiences of individuals in the social system.Read more at location 757   
 
Nelida’s failure demonstrates the importance of interpersonal networks in the adoption or rejection of an innovation.Read more at location 761   
 
How potential adopters view a change agent affects their willingness to adopt new ideas.Read more at location 770   
 
This tendency for more effective communication to occur with those who are more similar to a change agent occurs in most diffusion campaigns.Read more at location 776   
 
Unfortunately, those individuals who most need the help provided by the change agent are least likely to accept it.Read more at location 777   
 
Nelida was “innovation-oriented” rather than “client-oriented.” She was unable to put herself in the role of the village housewives, and thus her attempts at persuasion failed to reach her clients because the message did not suit their needs.Read more at location 778   
 
Diffusion is the process in which an innovation is communicated through certain channels over time among the members of a social system.Read more at location 783   
 
Diffusion is a special type of communication in which the messages are about a new idea. This newness of the idea in the message content gives diffusion its special character. The newness means that some degree of uncertainty is involved in diffusion. Uncertainty is the degree to which a number of alternatives are perceived with respect to the occurrence of an event and the relative probability of these alternatives.Read more at location 794   
 
Uncertainty implies a lack of predictability, of structure, of information. Information is a means of reducing uncertainty. Information is a difference in matter-energy that affects uncertainty in a situation where a choice exists among a set of alternatives (Rogers and Kincaid, 1981).Read more at location 797   
 
Diffusion is a kind of social change, defined as the process by which alteration occurs in the structure and function of a social system.Read more at location 800   
 
These results were so clear that one would have expected the British Navy to promptly adopt citrus juice for scurvy prevention on all ships. Not until 1747, about 150 years later, did James Lind, a British Navy physician who knew of Lancaster’s results, carry out another experiment on the HMS Salisbury.Read more at location 819   
 
Certainly, with this further solid evidence of the ability of citrus fruits to combat scurvy, one would expect the British Navy to have adopted this innovation for all ship’s crews on long sea voyages. In fact, it did so, but not until 1795, forty-eight years later, when scurvy was immediately wiped out. After only seventy more years, in 1865, the British Board of Trade adopted a similar policy and eradicated scurvy in the merchant marine.Read more at location 824   
 
Why were the authorities so slow to adopt the idea of citrus for scurvy prevention? Other, competing remedies for scurvy were also being proposed, and each such cure had its champions. For example, Captain Cook’s reports from his voyages in the Pacific did not provide support for curing scurvy with citrus fruits. Further, Dr. Lind was not a prominent figure in the field of naval medicine, and so his experimental findings did not get much attention.Read more at location 828   
 
Previously we defined diffusion as the process by which (1) an innovation (2) is communicated through certain channels (3) over time (4) among the members of a social system.Read more at location 882   
 
An innovation is an idea, practice, or object that is perceived as new by an individual or other unit of adoption.Read more at location 894   
 
The perceived newness of the idea for the individual determines his or her reaction to it. If an idea seems new to the individual, it is an innovation.Read more at location 897   
 
Such idea-only innovations have a relatively lower degree of observability and thus a slower rate of adoption.Read more at location 923   
 
Knowing of a technological innovation creates uncertainty about its consequences in the mind of potential adopters.Read more at location 935   
 
The potential advantage of a new idea impels an individual to exert effort to learn more about the innovation.Read more at location 936   
 
Once such information-seeking activities reduce uncertainty about the innovation’s expected consequences to a tolerable level, a decision concerning adoption or rejection can be made.Read more at location 937   
 
Thus, the innovation-decision process is essentially an information-seeking and information-processing activity in which an individual is motivated to reduce uncertainty about the advantages and disadvantages of the innovationRead more at location 939   
 
A technology cluster consists of one or more distinguishable elements of technology that are perceived as being closely interrelated.Read more at location 949   
 
Some change agencies promote a “package” of innovations because they find that the innovations are thus adopted more rapidly.Read more at location 951   
 
Relative advantage is the degree to which an innovation is perceived as better than the idea it supersedes. The degree of relative advantage may be measured in economic terms, but social prestige factors, convenience, and satisfaction are also important factors. It does not matter so much whether an innovation has a great deal of “objective” advantage. What does matter is whether an individual perceives the innovation as advantageous. The greater the perceived relative advantage of an innovation, the more rapid its rate of adoption will be.Read more at location 964   
 
Compatibility is the degree to which an innovation is perceived as being consistent with the existing values, past experiences, and needs of potential adopters.Read more at location 968   
 
The adoption of an incompatible innovation often requires the prior adoption of a new value system, which is a relatively slow process.Read more at location 970   
 
Complexity is the degree to which an innovation is perceived as difficult to understand and use.Read more at location 974   
 
Trialability is the degree to which an innovation may be experimented with on a limited basis. New ideas that can be tried on the installment plan will generally be adopted more quickly than innovations that are not divisible.Read more at location 978   
 
Observability is the degree to which the results of an innovation are visible to others.Read more at location 983   
 
Innovations that are perceived by individuals as having greater relative advantage, compatibility, trialability, and observability and less complexity will be adopted more rapidly than other innovations. Past research indicates that these five qualities are the most important char acteristics of innovations in explaining the rate of adoption. The first two attributes, relative advantage and compatability, are particularly important in explaining an innovation’s rate of adoption.Read more at location 989   
 
In the 1970s, diffusion scholars began to study the concept of re-invention, defined as the degree to which an innovation is changed or modified by a user in the process of adoption and implementation.Read more at location 998   
 
Some researchers measure re-invention as the degree to which an individual’s use of a new idea departs from the core or “mainline” version of the innovation promoted by a change agency (Eveland et al., 1977).Read more at location 1000   
 
Diffusion is a particular type of communication in which the message content that is exchanged is concerned with a new idea. The essence of the diffusion process is the information exchange through which one individual communicates a new idea to one or several others. At its most elementary form, the process involves (1) an innovation, (2) an individual or other unit of adoption that has knowledge of, or has experienced using, the innovation, (3) another individual or other unit that does not yet have knowledge of, or experience with, the innovation, and (4) a communication channel connecting the two units.Read more at location 1016   
 
Diffusion investigations show that most individuals do not evaluate an innovation on the basis of scientific studies of its consequences, although such objective evaluations are not entirely irrelevant, especially to the very first individuals who adopt. Instead, most people depend mainly upon a subjective evaluation of an innovation that is conveyed to them from other individuals like themselves who have already adopted the innovation.Read more at location 1030   
 
Homophily is the degree to which two or more individuals who interact are similar in certain attributes, such as beliefs, education, socioeconomic status, and the like.Read more at location 1037   
 
In a free-choice situation, when an individual can interact with any one of a number of other individuals, the tendency is to select someone who is very similar.Read more at location 1038   
 
Heterophily, the opposite of homophily, is defined as the degree to which two or more individuals who interact are different in certain attributes.Read more at location 1039   
 
Physical and social propinquity makes homophilous communication more likely to occur than heterophilous communication.Read more at location 1042   
 
When they share common meanings and a mutual subcultural language, and are alike in personal and social characteristics, the communication of new ideas is likely to have greater effects in terms of knowledge gain, attitude formation and change, and overt behavior change. When homophily is present, communication is therefore likely to be rewarding to both participants.Read more at location 1044   
 
One of the most distinctive problems in the diffusion of innovations is that the participants are usually quite heterophilous.Read more at location 1047   
 
A change agent, for instance, is more technically competent than his or her clients.Read more at location 1048   
 
The nature of diffusion demands that at least some degree of heterophily be present between the two participants in the communication process.Read more at location 1050   
 
The innovation-decision process is the process through which an individual (or other decision-making unit) passes from first knowledge of an innovation, to the formation of an attitude toward the innovation, to a decision to adopt or reject, to implementation and use of the new idea, and to confirmation of this decision. We conceptualize five main steps in the innovation-decision process: (1) knowledge, (2) persuasion, (3) decision, (4) implementation, and (5) confirmation.Read more at location 1062   
 
Knowledge is gained when an individual (or other decision-making unit) learns of the innovation’s existence and gains some understanding of how it functions.Read more at location 1066   
 
Persuasion takes place when an individual forms a favorable or unfavorable attitude toward the innovation.Read more at location 1067   
 
Decision occurs when an individual engages in activities that lead to a choice to adopt or reject the innovation.Read more at location 1068   
 
Implementation takes place when an individual puts an innovation into use. Re-invention is especially likely to occur at the implementation stage.Read more at location 1069   
 
Confirmation occurs when an individual seeks reinforcement of an innovation-decision that has already been made, but he or she may reverse this previous decision if exposed to conflicting messages about the innovation.Read more at location 1071   
 
The innovation-decision process is an information-seeking and information-processing activity in which an individual obtains information in order to gradually decrease uncertainty about the innovation.Read more at location 1073   
 
At this stage the individual wants to know what the innovation is and how and why it works. Mass media channels can effectively transmit such software information.Read more at location 1076   
 
at the persuasion stage, and especially at the decision stage, an individual seeks innovation-evaluation information in order to reduce uncertainty about an innovation’s expected consequences. Here an individual wants to know the innovation’s advantages and disadvantages for his or her own particular situation. Interpersonal communication networks with near peers are particularly likely to convey such evaluative information about an innovation.Read more at location 1077   
 
Mass media channels are not very important at this stage because their messages are general in nature, and an individual deciding to adopt wants to know specific information: Will the innovation be beneficial to me in my particular situation?Read more at location 1080   
 
The innovation-decision process can lead to either adoption, a decision to make full use of an innovation as the best course of action available, or rejection, a decision not to adopt an innovation.Read more at location 1084   
 
Diffusion occurs within a social system. The social structure of the system affects the innovation’s diffusion in several ways. The social system constitutes a boundary within which an innovation diffuses. Here we deal with how the system’s social structure affects diffusion, the effect of norms on diffusion, the roles of opinion leaders and change agents, types of innovation-decisions, and the consequences of innovation. Each of these issues involves relationships between the social system and the diffusion process that occurs within it.Read more at location 1139   
 
We define structure as the patterned arrangements of the units in a system. This structure gives regularity and stability to human behavior in a system; it allows one to predict behavior with some degree of accuracy. Thus, structure represents a type of information, in that it decreases uncertainty.Read more at location 1144   
 
The well-developed social structure in such a system consists of hierarchial positions, giving individuals in higher-ranked positions the right to issue orders to individuals of lower rank. Their orders are expected to be carried out. Such patterned social relationships among the members of a system constitute social structure, one type of structure.Read more at location 1148   
 
In addition to this formal structure among the units in a social system, an informal structure also exists in the interpersonal networks linking a system’s members, tracing who interacts with whom and under what circumstances.Read more at location 1150   
 
We define such communication structure as the differentiated elements that can be recognized in the patterned communication flows in a system. Previously we defined homophily as the degree to which two or more individuals in a system talk with others who are similar to them. A communication structure is thus often created in a system in which homophilous sets of individuals are grouped together in cliques.Read more at location 1152   
 
This situation might occur when complete strangers first come together. However, regular patterns soon begin to occur in the communication network of the system. These aspects of communication structure predict, in part, the behavior of individual members of the social system, including when they adopt an innovation.Read more at location 1156   
 
Katz (1961) remarked, “It is as unthinkable to study diffusion without some knowledge of the social structures in which potential adopters are located as it is to study blood circulation without adequate knowledge of the veins and arteries.”Read more at location 1161   
 
It is a rather complicated matter to untangle the effects of a system’s structure on diffusion, independent from the effects of the characteristics of individuals that make up the system.Read more at location 1164   
 
Individual innovativeness is affected both by an individual’s characteristics and by the nature of the social system in which the individual is a member.Read more at location 1178   
 
Norms are the established behavior patterns for the members of a social system. Norms define a range of tolerable behavior and serve as a guide or standard for the behavior of members of a social system. The norms of a system tell individuals what behavior they are expected to perform.Read more at location 1187   
 
A system’s norms can be a barrier to change,Read more at location 1189   
 
The most innovative member of a system is very often perceived as a deviant from the social system and is accorded a status of low credibility by the average members of the system.Read more at location 1195   
 
Certain other members of the system function as opinion leaders. They provide information and advice about innovations to many other individuals in the system.Read more at location 1197   
 
Opinion leadership is the degree to which an individual is able to influence other individuals’ attitudes or overt behavior informally in a desired way with relative frequency.Read more at location 1198   
 
Opinion leadership is earned and maintained by the individual’s technical competence, social accessibility, and conformity to the system’s norms.Read more at location 1200   
 
When the social system is oriented to change, the opinion leaders are more innovative; but when the system’s norms are opposed to change, the behavior of the leaders also reflects this norm.Read more at location 1201   
 
Through their conformity to the system’s norms, opinion leaders serve as a model for the innovation behavior of their followers. Opinion leaders thus exemplify and express the system’s structure.Read more at location 1203   
 
The most striking characteristic of opinion leaders is their unique and influential position in their system’s communication structure: they are at the center of interpersonal communication networks.Read more at location 1208   
 
A communication network consists of interconnected individuals who are linked by patterned flows of information. An opinion leader’s interpersonal networks allow him or her to serve as a social model whose innovative behavior is imitated by many other members of the system.Read more at location 1209   
 
The respect with which the opinion leader is held can be lost, however, if an opinion leader deviates too far from the norms of the system. Opinion leaders can be “worn out” by change agents who overuse them in diffusion activities.Read more at location 1211   
 
Opinion leaders may begin to be perceived by their peers as too much like professional change agents and therefore lose their credibility with their former followers.Read more at location 1213   
 
Opinion leaders are members of the social system in which they exert their influence.Read more at location 1214   
 
A change agent is an individual who influences clients’ innovation-decisions in a direction deemed desirable by a change agency. The change agent usually seeks to obtain the adoption of new ideas but may also attempt to slow down diffusion and prevent the adoption of undesirable innovations. Change agents often use opinion leaders in a social system as their lieutenants in diffusion activities.Read more at location 1216   
 
Change agents are usually professionals with a university degree in a technical field. This professional training, and the social status that goes with it, usually means that change agents are heterophilous from their typical clients, thus posing problems for effective communication about the innovations they are promoting.Read more at location 1219   
 
Innovations can be adopted or rejected (1) by an individual member of a system or (2) by the entire social system, which can decide to adopt an innovation by a collective or an authority decision.Read more at location 1225   
 
Optional innovation-decisions are choices to adopt or reject an innovation that are made by an individual independent of the decisions of the other members of the system.Read more at location 1227   
 
The distinctive aspect of optional innovation-decisions is that the individual is the main unit of decision making, rather than the social system.Read more at location 1231   
 
Collective innovation-decisions are choices to adopt or reject an innovation that are made by consensus among the members of a system.Read more at location 1235   
 
Diffusion is fundamentally a social process.Read more at location 1367
